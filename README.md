# Gym Members Exercise Dataset - EDA + Calorie prediction regression + Experience level classification

`Exploratory Data Analysis`

Analyzing and summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset, using visualizations, to understand its structure, detect patterns and spot anomalies in Gym  Members Dataset.

`Calories prediction`

This project addresses a Regression Machine Learning problem, aiming to build a predictive model for estimating calorie burn. The model leverages input features such as the type, duration, and intensity of physical activity, along with individual characteristics like age, weight, and gender. The objective is to accurately predict the calories burned during specific activities. This model offers valuable insights for individuals, fitness enthusiasts, and healthcare professionals, helping them optimize calorie management and plan physical activities more effectively.

`Experience level classification`

This project will address also a Classification Machine Learning problem. The goal of classifying the Experience Level of gym members is to better understand and categorize individuals based on their fitness proficiency. This classification can provide valuable insights for personalizing fitness programs, improving member engagement, and optimizing gym resources. By leveraging this classification, gyms can enhance their offerings, promote health and fitness, and create a more tailored experience for all members.
